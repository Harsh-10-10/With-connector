We have different file like tools,prompt ,validation_module,config,databricks_tool these are our main file and the test_flow_v2 can be our consider as our main file from where we can run this file and our code will run ,this was 1st 
when we use autogen then we the test_flow file will be of no use as we are importing everything in the my_agent file 

Hey I am working on a POC where I have to build an Schema Agent I have done most of the part the only thing which is remaining is that I have not structured the code part like functions part is missing in my case also we have a two case like we will be asking some input from the user that is fine but then our code is sent to the agent part  

okay it is like my file has validation_module it is the main file, config file, prompt file, databricks_tool file , tools file, so when I ran the validation file my code is work from start to end 
after that I have to move to the autogen part which the 2nd thing so in that case I have to disabled some part of the validation module which I will be calling in the autogen file
